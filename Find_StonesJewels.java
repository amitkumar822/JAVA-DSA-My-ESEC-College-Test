/*
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and s representing the stones you have. Each
character in s is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and s are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is
considered a different type of stone from "A".
Example 1:
Input: J = "aA", S
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: J - "z", S
Output: 0
" aAAbbbb"
"ZZ"
Note:
â€¢
s and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
